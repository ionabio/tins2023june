Notes:

#Basegame# is just a trying of the walk throught in the wiki here:
https://github.com/liballeg/allegro_wiki/wiki/Allegro-Vivace-%E2%80%93-Basic-game-structure

the `allegro` package is added using nuget to packages folder of the game, which is ignored in git

I have tried using cmake also, but it involved more steps. This will be used for future scafolding.

#Birdies# folder contains a PyGame of a game. Easy to run via `python main.py`. Be sure pygame is installed using `pip`.
